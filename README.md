# Indiegogo-Clone 
This Readme contains details about my project. I have built a cloned website of Yoox.com with some of its basic functionalities. This overall project was a part of our construct week at Masai School. 

## About Project:

Millions of people around the world visit Indiegogo to find clever and unconventional things that solve everyday problems large and small. By giving entrepreneurs everywhere a platform to launch new and groundbreaking products, Indiegogo helps surface innovations in tech, design, and much more, all before they go mainstream. 

Indiegogo provides the opportunity to support entrepreneurs and new technology from the earliest stages of development. Indiegogo's crowdfunding campaigns are where new and groundbreaking products take flight, sometimes long before they hit mainstream availability. 

So, we picked up one of the sections in which one can fund any project and createed a userflow by cloning the Indiegogo's basic functionalities.
